# Email Extractor Userscript

This userscript is designed to extract email addresses from the class list table in a D2L (Desire2Learn) learning shell. It simplifies the process of copying email addresses for use in other systems, such as the AWS Academy Learning Management System.

## Features

- Adds an "Extract Emails" button to the D2L class list page.
- Extracts email addresses from the table and copies them to your clipboard.
- Provides notifications to confirm when emails have been copied or if no emails were found.

## Why Use This Script?

As an instructor or administrator using both D2L and AWS Academy Learning Management System, you often need to move student email lists between systems. This script saves you time by automatically extracting the email addresses from D2L and copying them to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into AWS Academy or any other system.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have a userscript manager installed in your web browser. We recommend Violentmonkey, but Tampermonkey is also supported.

1. **Install a Userscript Manager**:
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) (recommended)
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

   - Click [here](https://github.com/oap/email-extractor-userscript/raw/main/email-extractor.user.js) to install the script.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the D2L Class List Page**:
   - Open your D2L platform and go to the class list page for the course youâ€™re interested in.

2. **Click the "Extract Emails" Button**:
   - A new "Extract Emails" button will appear in the D2L interface. Click this button to extract all email addresses from the class list.

3. **Use the Email List in Other Systems**:
   - The email addresses will be copied to your clipboard automatically. You can now paste them directly into the AWS Academy Learning Management System or any other platform.

## Permissions
